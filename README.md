### Hi there 👋

I'm Merim Kulovac, an engineer and software enthusiast based in Sarajevo. With a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering specialized in Computer Science and Informatics, I'm on a perpetual quest to explore the dynamic landscape of technology. You can check some of my projects below.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Angular
- Backend: Java Spring Boot, Node.js, ASP.NET
- Other Languages: C, C++, Python

## ♟️ Passion Beyond Tech
I'm not just about code! I'm an avid chess player, relishing the strategic intricacies of the game. When I'm not immersed in code or chess, you can find me pumping iron at the gym. Just as in coding, consistent effort at the gym yields the best results.

## 🌐 Let's Collaborate
I'm always up for exciting collaborations and projects that merge my engineering prowess with coding finesse. Whether it's engineering, coding, chess, or simply discussing tech trends, I'm just a message away. Let's engineer innovative solutions and make technology work for us! 🚀
